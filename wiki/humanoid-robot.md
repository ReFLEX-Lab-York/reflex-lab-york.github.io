# Humanoid Robot (Unitree G1)

[Three computers](https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/three-computers-robotics/) are needed to train and deploy robot technology:

1. A supercomputer to train and fine-tune powerful foundation and generative AI models.
2. A development platform for robotics simulation and testing.
3. An onboard runtime computer to deploy trained models to physical robots.

Only after adequate training in simulated environments can physical robots be commissioned.


## The Three Computing Systems

1. Training Computer
The [NVIDIA DGX platform](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/dgx-platform/) can serve as the first computing system to train models.

2. Development & Simulation Platform
NVIDIA Omniverse running on [NVIDIA OVX](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/products/ovx/) servers functions as the second computer system, providing the development platform and simulation environment for testing, optimizing and debugging physical AI.

3. Onboard Runtime Computer
NVIDIA Jetson Thor robotics computers designed for onboard computing serve as the third runtime computer.
