# Sensors

The lab is equipped with a variety of cameras and sensors for robotics, computer vision, and research applications:

## Depth Cameras

- **ZED 1**  
  Stereoscopic depth camera capable of generating accurate 3D environment maps. Suitable for robotics, SLAM, and immersive applications.

- **Intel RealSense D435i**  
  RGB-D camera featuring an integrated IMU for 6-DOF motion tracking. Ideal for SLAM, object detection, robotics perception, and hand tracking.

- **Microsoft Kinect (original)**  
  Classic RGB-D sensor widely used for human body tracking, gesture recognition, and 3D scanning.

## Monocular Cameras

- **Logitech Brio**  
  4K ultra high-resolution USB webcam, primarily used for video conferencing, demonstration recordings, and general-purpose imaging.

- **Sony PlayStation 3 Eye**  
  High-frame-rate USB cameras commonly deployed in multi-camera setups for group motion capture, marker tracking, and computer vision research.

## LiDAR

- **RP LIDAR A1**  
  2D spinning LiDAR sensor. Useful for indoor mapping, obstacle detection, and autonomous navigation experiments.
